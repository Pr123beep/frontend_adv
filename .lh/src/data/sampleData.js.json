From AI-driven analytics and remote patient monitoring to cloud-based interoperability solutions, we ensure that healthcare providers have the tools they need to deliver smarter, safer, and more connected care.\\n\\nBut for me, healthcare has always been more than just technology—it’s about impact.\\n\\nWith 30+ years in technology leadership, I know that true innovation happens at the intersection of tech and human impact.

Thousands of companies match employee donations to various non-profits. Unfortunately, the existing process is cumbersome and under-utilized. We have set up a tool to electronically manage the matching process, making it easier for donations to be matched and as a result, increasing revenues for charities.

Amid the uncertainty, I saw how fragile life is and how profoundly technology can transform healthcare. That realization led me to launch Emorphis Health, committed to building next-gen healthcare solutions that bridge the gap between technology and patient care.\\n\\nThen, last year, my mission became deeply personal.\\n\\nJust minutes before a family road trip, I suffered a heart attack. I survived because of a simple yet profound act of kindness—a stranger had once handed me a packet of life-saving medicines, insisting, “Keep this. It might help someone someday.” That moment reinforced what I’ve always believed: healthcare isn’t just about software—it’s about human connection.\\n\\nThat belief drives everything we do. From AI-driven analytics and remote patient monitoring to cloud-based interoperability solutions, we ensure that healthcare providers have the tools they need to deliver smarter, safer, and more connected care.\\n\\nBut for me, healthcare has always been more than just technology—it’s about impact.\\n\\nWith 30+ years in technology leadership, I know that true innovation happens at the intersection of tech and human impact. We deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent health-tech solutions that empower healthcare providers and enhance patient outcomes. At Emorphis Health, we specialize in seamless EHR & cloud integration, interoperability, and HIPAA-compliant platforms, ensuring real-time data exchange and smarter decision-making. With HL7 & FHIR standards, we create connected healthcare ecosystems that drive efficiency and improve care delivery.\\n\\nIf you believe in creating, innovating, and transforming digital health, let’s connect—no pitches, no jargon, just a shared commitment to making healthcare smarter, more secure, and truly patient-centric.\",\r\n-              \"Experience\": [\r\n-                {\r\n-                  \"Role\": \"Healthcare Technology Innovator | Product Engineering Authority | Mission-Driven Leader\",\r\n-                  \"Company\": \"Emorphis Health\",\r\n-                  \"Date\": \"Sep 2022 - Present\",\r\n-                  \"Location\": \"United States\",\r\n-                  \"Description\": \"With over 30 years of expertise in healthcare technology and product engineering, I am passionate about transforming healthcare systems to improve lives on a global scale.

Through Algogi Labs, our team subscription model, we’re making it easier for startups to scale their tech teams without the usual hassles of hiring and management.\\n\\nI’m also building IndoStream, a platform aimed at empowering creators and turning India into a global creative hub.\\n\\nIn today’s world, where so many are focused on building their own ventures, I believe collaboration is the real key to success. By sharing knowledge, working together, and supporting each other, we can create something far bigger than what we could achieve on our own.\\n\\nIf you’re a founder or innovator working on something exciting but need the right tech partner to bring it to life, let’s connect.

We resolve employee IT and HR issues at scale with automation and conversational AI, all within the platforms employees already use for instant communication. No more waiting days in queues for simple L1/L2 tickets, no more time and money directed towards self-help or automatable issues, and no more lack of visibility into how and where employees need help at work. Our virtual assistant works 24/7/365 to keep employees satisfied and productive, no matter where they are located or what language they speak.\\n\\nDon't take my word for it - IT leaders at Slack, Broadcom and Palo Alto Networks can talk about how we save them 350k+ employee productivity hours a year, resolve 55% of employee help requests within seconds, or create 98% employee satisfaction with IT.\\n\\nWant to talk?

Used my own blood for experiments and sensor development.\\n\\nCool things I did at college -\\n- Soccer Playing Robots, participated internationally at FIRA\\n- High Speed Imaging Micro-Fluidics Research @ Purdue, TU Darmstadt and IITKgp\\n- Best All Rounder Technology Awardee by the College for participating and winning a ton of competitions.\",\r\n-        \"Experience\": [\r\n-          {\r\n-            \"Role\": \"Co-Founder\",\r\n-            \"Company\": \"Stealth\",\r\n-            \"Date\": \"Aug 2024 - Present\",\r\n-            \"Location\": \"Location Not Found\",\r\n-            \"Description\": \"Building Physical AI Agents for the Construction Industry.\"\r\n-          },\r\n-          {\r\n-            \"Role\": \"Head of R&D and Hardware\",\r\n-            \"Company\": \"Morphle Labs Inc\",\r\n-            \"Date\": \"Feb 2021 - Jul 2024\",\r\n-            \"Location\": \"Bengaluru, Karnataka, India\",\r\n-            \"Description\": \"Led R\"\r\n-          },\r\n-          {\r\n-            \"Role\": \"Technology Development Engineer\",\r\n-            \"Company\": \"Wrig Nanosystems\",\r\n-            \"Date\": \"Jun 2016 - Nov 2020\",\r\n-            \"Location\": \"New Delhi, Delhi, India\",\r\n-            \"Description\": \"Product Development lead for a new generation of Bio-Medical diagnostic devices.\"\r\n-          },\r\n-          {\r\n-            \"Role\": \"Undergraduate Researcher\",\r\n-            \"Company\": \"Microfluidics Lab, IIT Kharagpur\",\r\n-            \"Date\": \"Apr 2013 - May 2016\",\r\n-            \"Location\": \"Kharagpur Area, India\",\r\n-            \"Description\": \"Student Researcher Under Prof. Suman Chakraborty, working on Electro-Wetting of Non-Newtonian and Newtonian Fluids on Dielectric (EWOD) of Sessile Liquid Droplets on Rheologically Tuned Soft Surfaces and their Dynamic Response.\"\r\n-          },\r\n-          {\r\n-            \"Role\": \"Undergraduate Researcher\",\r\n-            \"Company\": \"Kharagpur Robosoccer Students Group\",\r\n-            \"Date\": \"Mar 2012 - May 2016\",\r\n-            \"Location\": \"Kharagpur Area, India\",\r\n-            \"Description\": \"Student Researcher under Dr. J.

From AI-driven analytics and remote patient monitoring to cloud-based interoperability solutions, we ensure that healthcare providers have the tools they need to deliver smarter, safer, and more connected care.\\n\\nBut for me, healthcare has always been more than just technology—it’s about impact.\\n\\nWith 30+ years in technology leadership, I know that true innovation happens at the intersection of tech and human impact.

Now, I’m applying that same thinking to a far bigger challenge: healthcare administration.\\n\\nHealthcare spends $1T a year on administration, with RCM processes alone consuming 50% of that. Prior authorizations, claims processing, and revenue cycle inefficiencies delay payments, create unnecessary denials, and keep hospitals buried in paperwork instead of patient care.\\n\\nAs Founder & CEO of 100ms, I’m focused on eliminating latency in healthcare—making processes work seamlessly, instantly, and at scale. Our AI agents remove friction in revenue cycle management, cutting out the waiting, reducing denials, and ensuring hospitals get paid faster—so staff can stop chasing paperwork and doctors can focus on patient care.\",\r\n             \"Experience\": [\r\n@@ -142,8 +142,9 @@\n               \"Degree\": \"Bachelor of Technology (BTech), Electrical and Electronics Engineering\",\r\n               \"Date\": \"2006 - 2010\"\r\n             },\r\n             \"Company\": \"100ms\"\r\n+\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n       },\r\n       {\r\n@@ -5991,9 +5992,9 @@\n           \"Kartik Luke Singh\"\r\n         ],\r\n         \"linkedin-data\": {\r\n           \"Kartik Luke Singh\": {\r\n-            \"LinkedIn URL\": \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kartikluke/\",\r\n+            \"LinkedIn URL\": \"\",\r\n             \"Bio\": \"Throughout my career, I've been building startup products with an eye for everything; from the tables in the database to the pixels on the page.
