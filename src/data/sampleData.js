            "Bio": "Entrepreneur and engineer passionate about building technology that eliminates friction—first in live video, now in healthcare.\n\nAt Disney and Meta, I built real-time infrastructure that made global-scale video seamless, instant, and reliable. Now, I’m applying that same thinking to a far bigger challenge: healthcare administration.\n\nHealthcare spends $1T a year on administration, with RCM processes alone consuming 50% of that. Prior authorizations, claims processing, and revenue cycle inefficiencies delay payments, create unnecessary denials, and keep hospitals buried in paperwork instead of patient care.\n\nAs Founder & CEO of 100ms, I’m focused on eliminating latency in healthcare—making processes work seamlessly, instantly, and at scale. Our AI agents remove friction in revenue cycle management, cutting out the waiting, reducing denials, and ensuring hospitals get paid faster—so staff can stop chasing paperwork and doctors can focus on patient care.",

I founded AIndra Systems, a Startup creating products in the area of Computer Vision, a domain under Artificial Intelligence. \n\nAindra's Vision is to create products that have a deep impact on the society and believes that this vision can be achieved by the use of Artificially Intelligent technology. The idea for the startup came when I was asked to find a solution to the problem of subsidy leakage in Govt sanctioned schemes for the rural school-going children.\n\nAindra is now leveraging the AI platform that we built and are building products in the extremely cutting edge domain of 'Computational Pathology'. We are working on developing a Point-of-Care cancer detection platform that has, as its heart, an Artificial Intelligence engine. We believe technology can democratise healthcare in India and other developing countries.\n\nI was chosen as a delegate of the Global Entrepreneurship Summit held in San Francisco in 2016 organised by the US govt. I was selected by State of Karnataka to represent the startup community at BioKorea in 2016 and also one of the 5 startup founders selected by Dept of Biotechnology to visit Cambridge UK in 2016.\n\nI am active in the Startup ecosystem in Bangalore and meet Entrepreneurs regularly and help in organizing meetups and events centered around startups. I have been a Program Leader for the Startup Leadership Program, a global Entrepreneurship program.\n\nAt Aindra Systems, I take care of Market sensing, Opportunity sizing, Product Management, Business Development and Sales. I am ably supported by a young and enthusiastic team and mentored by some extremely sharp veterans.\n\nSpecialties':\n* Market Sensing\n* Opportunity Sizing\n* Lean Methodologies\n* Product Management\n* Business Development\n* Startup strategies",

Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work with startups, solve real-world problems, and turn ideas into scalable solutions.\n\nToday, I’m the CEO of Algogi Technologies, where we help founders and businesses not just build software but apply technology to grow and thrive. Through Algogi Labs, our team subscription model, we’re making it easier for startups to scale their tech teams without the usual hassles of hiring and management.\n\nI’m also building IndoStream, a platform aimed at empowering creators and turning India into a global creative hub.\n\nIn today’s world, where so many are focused on building their own ventures, I believe collaboration is the real key to success. By sharing knowledge, working together, and supporting each other, we can create something far bigger than what we could achieve on our own.\n\nIf you’re a founder or innovator working on something exciting but need the right tech partner to bring it to life, let’s connect. I’d love to hear your story and explore how we can build something impactful—together.",

            "Bio": "The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why — Mark Twain. \n\nCOVID-19 gave me that clarity. Amid the uncertainty, I saw how fragile life is and how profoundly technology can transform healthcare. That realization led me to launch Emorphis Health, committed to building next-gen healthcare solutions that bridge the gap between technology and patient care.\n\nThen, last year, my mission became deeply personal.\n\nJust minutes before a family road trip, I suffered a heart attack. I survived because of a simple yet profound act of kindness—a stranger had once handed me a packet of life-saving medicines, insisting, “Keep this. It might help someone someday.” That moment reinforced what I’ve always believed: healthcare isn’t just about software—it’s about human connection.\n\nThat belief drives everything we do. From AI-driven analytics and remote patient monitoring to cloud-based interoperability solutions, we ensure that healthcare providers have the tools they need to deliver smarter, safer, and more connected care.\n\nBut for me, healthcare has always been more than just technology—it’s about impact.\n\nWith 30+ years in technology leadership, I know that true innovation happens at the intersection of tech and human impact. We deliver scalable, secure, and intelligent health-tech solutions that empower healthcare providers and enhance patient outcomes. At Emorphis Health, we specialize in seamless EHR & cloud integration, interoperability, and HIPAA-compliant platforms, ensuring real-time data exchange and smarter decision-making. With HL7 & FHIR standards, we create connected healthcare ecosystems that drive efficiency and improve care delivery.\n\nIf you believe in creating, innovating, and transforming digital health, let’s connect—no pitches, no jargon, just a shared commitment to making healthcare smarter, more secure, and truly patient-centric.",
